## TODO
- Moderation Commands
  - [ ] `/announcement <message>` (presumably using a multi-line text edit control, assuming you can fit an entire message in there, that is) 
  - [ ] `/skip ( "Glyph" | "Ambigram" )` Mark next week as special. 
  - [x] `/submit ( "Glyph" | "Ambigram" ) <prompt>` 
    - [x] Display a preview of the announcement message (or just outright send it in the bot chat or whatever) and add a ‘Confirm’ button.
  - [ ] `/userdata <user> <entry> <value>`
- User Commands
  - [ ] `/help <topic>` Show help information for a specific topic. Specifically: `commands` to list all commands (only list moderation commands if the user is a moderator).
  - [x] `/nickname` 
  - [ ] `/profile`
    - [x] self
    - [ ] others
    - [ ] button to change nickname

- Events
  - [x] Add submission on reaction add

    - [ ] Automatically generate a panel of all submissions from the previous week.
  - [ ] Send hall of fame message for the week before.
